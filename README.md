# Find_LegoPiece

Identify LEGO piece (Final project for the Building AI course)

## Summary

Image recognition app which can identify Lego piece in a given lot.

## Background

Kids playing with lego spend lot of time in identifying lego pieces from the lego box. I have been frequently asked by them to find them. I think, AI can help us here in finding it quickly.

## How is it used?

Following are the steps to use it:

1. Open Find_LegoPiece App in Mobile/Tab
2. Select the Lego piece you are looking for.
3. Hover the App over the Lego box.
4. App should detect the piece.
5. If not, then shuffle pieces in the Lego box and try again.

## Data sources and AI methods

Lego parts list are available in following URL: [https://rebrickable.com/api/v3/docs/]

## Challenges

Part of the required Lego piece would be hidden by other Lego pieces. Identifying the lego piece in such situation would be major challenge.

## What next?

This project can extend to identify people from the crowded places.

## Acknowledgments

None at the moment.
